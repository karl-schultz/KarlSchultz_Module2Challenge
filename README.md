# KarlSchultz_Module2Challenge
This is Karl Schultz's submission for Week 2 Challenge assignment for University of Oregon Data Analytics Bootcamp. This repository contains screenshots of 
the fully realized project in Excel with the vba code delivering all the correct outputs for the multiple_year_stock_data.xslm file. The screenshots
are named in terms of year as is the name of the individual sheets in the Excel file. I've also included the visual basic code to run these results
at user's leisure. Simply go into excel and import vba code or copy from notepad file to create macro. Then run macro named ModuleChallenge to see 
results replicated.
